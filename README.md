Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM)

Overview: Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM) is an open-source glacier evolution model coded in Python that models the transient evolution of glaciers. Each glacier is modeled independently using a monthly timestep. PyGEM has a modular framework that allows different schemes to be used for model calibration or model physics (e.g., climatic mass balance, glacier dynamics).

Manual: Details concerning the model physics, installation, and running the model may be found here: https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM.wiki.git

Usage: PyGEM is meant for large-scale glacier evolution modeling.

Contributing: We welcome contributions from any interested parties and are in the process of outlining how to best incorporate outside contributions. For the time being, if you would like to contribute to the development of the model, please contact David Rounce (drounce@alaska.edu).
